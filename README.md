# JukeboxColabNotebooks
A collection of Google Colaboratory Notebooks for OpenAI's Jukebox

I made all of the notebooks as simple as possible to use.
They use the Kopie Von Version (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VXWfIRN7X4LGs_FnmuHLI3ct-wRYXpCA?usp=sharing), so they won't run out of memory.
